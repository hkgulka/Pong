# Introduction

This project was designed as a remake of the classic arcade game "Pong". 
The aim of the game is to score on your opponent and prevent them from scoring on you, 
controlling your side's paddle to block and hit the ball as it approaches.

Some added functionality of this program includes pausing the game via the 'esc' button,
quitting the game early, and the option to play a new match at the end of the game.

# Goals

- Create a functional game that can be played from one computer by running the application - done
- Add multiplayer functionality using web sockets, so that the game can be played on two separate devices (one for each player) in different locations
